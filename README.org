* Digital Elevation Model Compression using an Autoencoder

This is a small project for educational purposes and to showcase my current skills.

I am trying to evaluate the feasibility of Autoencoders for the compression of digital elevation models.

A model like this could help save bandwith in cloud based map applications.
The smaller compressed representations make both storage and transmission of data easier. In such a scenario compression would happen on the server side with the encoder part of the network. and then on a mobile device the information could be decompressed using the decoder part of the network.

Since compression like this is lossy, I would suggest to use such a system only for areas of the map which are not supposed to be in focus.




* Current status
The intitial architecture is working, the boilerplate training and testing loops are setup, but the model still fails to converge.
** Data
The data consists out of squares that I cut out of 5m resolution geotifs of the austrian counties Tyrol, Salzburg, and Carinthia. Each square has an area of 6.25kmÂ².
*** Amount of collected datapoints
| subset | #geotifs |
|--------+----------|
| train  |     2236 |
| test   |      279 |
| dev    |      279 |
|--------+----------|
| sum    |     2794 |

** Roadmap

- [X] Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- [X] Data Loader
- [X] Model Architecture
- [X] Training and Testing loops
- [ ] Additional data collection
- [ ] Architecture Adjustments
- [ ] Model Tuning

** Architecture Improvements
Currently the network is just a simple autoencoder, but also VAEs and other more  architectures could be considered.
